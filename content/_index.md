# 👨‍💻 **About Me** {#about-me}

I’m an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wenya Wang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wangwy/).
Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Tianjin University (TJU) and M.Eng. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University (THU).

Along the way, I’ve been fortunate to work with some amazing researchers and mentors.
I worked as a remote research intern at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with Prof. [Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/), which turned out to be one of the most rewarding and enjoyable experiences I've had.
I also interned as a research assistant at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST-GZ), where I had the pleasure of collaborating with Prof. [Chengwei Qin](https://qcwthu.github.io/).
In addition, I spent over a year as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).



**Research Interests**: My early research mainly focused on Graph Data Mining and AI4Sec, and you may find some of my representative work here: [TFE-GNN@WWW'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16713), [TGSL@CIKM'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07699), and [MH-Net@AAAI'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03279). 


🔍 Currently, I’m focusing on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their synergy with **Graphs**. Some of my recent works include: [GoR@ACL'25 Main](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11001), [Router-R1](), and [FusionBench]().

I really enjoy playing badminton🏸! I was on the university or departmental team during both undergrad and grad school.

I also trained in table tennis🏓 as a kid — though it's been quite a few years since I last picked up a paddle...😅
